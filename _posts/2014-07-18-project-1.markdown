description: A dragon simulation game where you attack civilians, fight dragons, and archers. Contains two game modes:
Survival: Survive for as long as you can by fighting waves of archers and dragons. The final score gets updated to google leader board.
Challenge: Includes 10 levels where you have to complete tasks in each level to unlock the next one. I have implemented all logic in this game from scratch except two of the Assets from Asset Store:
EasyTouch Joystick
PyroParticle Fires
I have also integrated ads from IronSource, Heyzap, Chartboost, Unity Ads, StartApp, AdMob, Fyber, AppLovin in this game.
